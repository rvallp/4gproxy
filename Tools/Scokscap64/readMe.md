## Software Description

SocksCap64 support the 32-bit and 64-bit system of Windows XP/Vista/Win7/Win8/Win8.1/Win10 perfectly.

SocksCap64, developed by Taro. It’s designed to reduce delays of cross-regional online game. It can also  assist you to speed up of the network through the socks proxy server, reduce ping of online games. SocksCap64 currently support the SOCKS 4/SOCKS 5/HTTP/Shadowsocks protocols, supports TCP and UDP.

SocksCap64 provides great convenience for Windows applications to visit the network through a SOCKS proxy. SocksCap64, compared with VPN, is more convenient, considering the fact that the entire traffic went through the VPN, once the VPN is connected. It means that the games you are playing and the IM software online need reconnection. But with SocksCap64, what the users need to do is to open an application without any mutual influence. Of course, some browser plugins can also have such a function like SocksCap64. But they have some obvious defects. They don’t support proxies with account password authentication; their configurations are relatively complex; and only several mainstreams browsers have such kinds of plugins.

The SocksCap64 prototype comes from the author’s personal use of a game proxy tool. One day, I sent this software to a friend. After the friend used it, he was amazed by the tool and said: “You should put it to internet and make it available to netizens who have the same needs worldwide.” So the author accepted the suggestion and organize this private proxy tool into an easy-to-use software.
