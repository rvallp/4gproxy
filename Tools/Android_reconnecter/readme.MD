This app just for the user who use phone as proxies but didnot use our official app, to do ip rotation in this case, you can write youroself script, but you can also use this app.

1. Install the app in phone
2. Set api address according your allproxy service address, for e.g: http://yourserver:9081
3. Set the uniqueId of this phone which you can see in the dashboard.

NOTE:
You need to set apiAddr(e.g: http://anything) in conf_client.yaml to any invalid value to make the "Root Button" shows in dashboard.
